# Redback_Racing_CAN_READER
This is a repo for our core electronics article, this repo gives you access to the code base directly and can be used in any project you want!

For a basic rundown:

Main.c is the only script you should need to edit, all processes for interacting with can are already highlighted there so you can copy and paste and do whatever you wish!

The CanReader and CanSender scripts don't need to be played with, similar to the proto and nanopb folders, if your technically skilled you might enjoy changing there configurations but these will work as is.

Okay thats everything, enjoy!!
